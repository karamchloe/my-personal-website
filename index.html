            Greetings, I'm an aspiring software engineer with a passion for crafting and designing.
            Whether it's crafting physical objects or sculpting digital figurines using software like Blender for 3D printing, I enjoy turning my ideas into tangible reality.
             The prospect of expressing myself freely through this medium truly excites me. 
            I especially like that it allows me to interface with computers and my own digital universe, just like this my-intro-website that I've created.
             It offers boundless potential, giving me a platform to not only bring my imaginings to life but also to engage with others and share my concepts limitlessly without the constraints of physical space or time.
             Even while I rest, the digital realm remains active.
             <br>

            During my preparatory endeavors over the past month, I found a special joy in mastering keyboard shortcuts.
             It was an insight that nearly every interaction with the computer can be arranged through the terminal and keys, completely bypassing the need for a mouse.
              It feels like I've acquired a key to a secret realm of computing, where practicality and efficiency is everything.
              <br>
        </p>
        <p>     
            Proficiency in computer interaction is an indispensable skill, especially in today's world where technology becomes outdated in the blink of an eye. Staying attuned to the fundamentals of these advancements is what ensures one stays informed.
            As the saying goes, "you only see what you know." Even with just a basic understanding of coding languages, I've already glimpsed a new world that was previously veiled to me.
             I am grateful every day for having the time, energy, and youth to devote to this intricate language of computing.
              I look forward to the day when I can proudly call myself a proficient software engineer.</p>
