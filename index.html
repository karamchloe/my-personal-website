            Greetings, I'm an aspiring software engineer with a passion for crafting and designing.
            Whether it's crafting physical objects or sculpting digital figurines using software like Blender for 3D printing, I enjoy turning my ideas into tangible reality.
            I especially like that it allows me to interface with computers and my own digital universe.
             It offers boundless potential, giving me a platform to not only bring my imaginings to life but also to engage with others and share my concepts limitlessly without the constraints of physical space or time.
             Even while I rest, the digital realm remains active! 
             <br>

            During my preparatory endeavors over the past months, I found a special joy in mastering keyboard shortcuts.
             It was a life quality enhancer as well as an insight that nearly every interaction with the computer can be arranged through the terminal and keys, completely bypassing the need for a mouse.
              It feels like I've acquired a key to a secret realm of computing, where practicality and efficiency is everything.
              <br>
        </p>
        <p>     
            As the saying goes, "you only see what you know." Even with just a basic understanding of coding languages, I've already glimpsed a new world that was previously veiled to me.
             I am grateful every day for having the time, energy, and youth to devote to this intricate language of computing.
              I look forward to the day when I can proudly call myself a proficient software engineer.</p>
